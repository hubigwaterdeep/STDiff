<p align="center">Overview of STDiff framework. The sketch feature is first extracted with two level attention modules for sparse embedding and then flows with multi-head attention fusion to text. With the embedded features, we proposed a staged denoising probabilistic diffusion model for both the geometry and appearance of 3D shapes.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>The code is coming soon.</p>
